Movie Buff
----------
This is a partial solution (showing the work done after the [quick-start tutorial on neo-forgery](https://medium.com/neo4j/how-to-mock-neo4j-calls-in-node-7066c52ac468).)

The whole point of this is to show how to test with [neo-forgery](https://www.npmjs.com/package/neo-forgery).

The [more complete solution](https://github.com/YizYah/movieBuff) reflects changes not included in the tutorial.

To run the test, first run `npm i` and then 
call `npm test`.
